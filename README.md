# Labelme config

## Introduction

This repository contains configuration and exporting files for labelme (exporting labelme data to other formats).

**So far, only Windows is supported for starting labelme.**

## How to install

Simply clone this repository. When starting labelme using the batch files, all the files will update to the latest commit.

## Running labelme

Double click the `start_labelme.bat` or use the command line:

```powershell
./start_labelme.bat <optional: specify a picture directory>
```

## Deprecated

`start_labelme_legacy.bat` is deprecated and exports files in a different format. `export.py` can still parse it, but it is turned off by default.

## Export files

Currently, `export.py` supports exporting to [YOLOv4](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark/issues/60#issuecomment-401854885) and [vehicle attributes](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/training_extensions/tree/misc/misc/tensorflow_toolkit/vehicle_attributes) formats.

### Usage

Write into the terminal:

```powershell
python export.py -h
```

(you might have to change `python` to `python3` if you are not on Windows). That will show you all the possible commands.

Point `export.py` at your data directory and make sure all folders with data are prefixed with an exclamation mark (‚ùó) (can be changed). You can also just doubleclick (will use this directory).

Default export format is YOLO.
